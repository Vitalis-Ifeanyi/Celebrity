    <p>David Adedeji Adeleke was born on November 21, 1992, in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. His father Adedeji Adeleke (b. 1957) is a business magnate from Nigeria, and his mother Vero Adeleke (1963â€“2003) was a university lecturer. Davido is the youngest of five siblings and his father's third-born son.<br><br> He attended the British International School in Lagos, and at the age of 16, he returned to the U.S. to study business administration at Oakwood University, Alabama. While at Oakwood, Davido bought musical equipment and started making beats. He also formed the music act KB International with his cousins B-Red and Sina Rambo.<br><br> Davido dropped out of Oakwood University to pursue music full-time and relocated to London, where he worked on his vocals. After returning to Nigeria in 2011, Davido paused his music career and agreed to honor his father by enrolling at Babcock University, from which he graduated in July 2015, with a degree in music after his father paid the university to start a music department for an inaugural class of one student.</p>
